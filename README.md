# JavaScript Learning Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This collection contains all the material, code snippets, and practice files I created while learning JavaScript. The repository is organized to cover various topics, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced concepts like asynchronous programming and working with APIs.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

### Basics:
- **Introduction to JavaScript**
- **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**
- **Control Structures** (if-else, switch, loops)
- **Functions and Scope**

### Intermediate Concepts:
- **Arrays and Objects**
